# Stardust's Icon and Graphics Archive
<p style="text-align: center;">An archive of retro graphics, including icons, dividers, backgrounds, banners, stamps, blinkies, buttons, cursors, etc. from varying sources and websites
<br>These graphics have been sourced from various websites, and I will make sure to credit all my sources.
<br>Please let me know if you want particular credit or if you want your graphics removed, I will oblige if necessary!
<footer>this is my first time making a GitHub repo that is actually something. Please don't judge me</p></footer>
